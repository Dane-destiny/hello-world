It was sunday. I never get up early on sunday. I sometimes stay in bed until lunch time. Last sunday, I got up very late. I looked out of the window. I was dark outside. "It's rainnign again" I thought "What a day!". Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. "I've just arrived by train" She said "I am coming to see you".But I am still having breakfast. 
"What are you doing?" She asked.
"I'm having breakfast." I said.
"Dear me!" she said "Do you always get up so late?"
